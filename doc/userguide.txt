# Introduction
This is a C++ library meant to provide implementations of the most commonly used
geodetic calculations. The whole library is wrapped around the `dso` namespace.

# Dependancies 
This library uses the [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) 
library for basic matrix manipulation and linear algebra.

# Compilation / Installation
Building the library requires [cmake](https://cmake.org/)

Supposing we are at the top-level directory (i.e. where this readme file is placed), 
just use:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

# The Library

## Coordinate Types

A point $P$ can be defined can be described (in 3-D space) by any of the following 
coordinate types:

 * **Cartesian**, using $P = (x,y,z)$; unless otherwise stated, in SI units (i.e. meters)
 * **Geodetic**, using $P= (\lambda , \phi , h)$, $\lambda$ denoting the 
  longitude in range $-\pi \le \lambda \le \pi$, $\phi$ denoting the geodetic
  latitude in range $\frac{\pi}{2} \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $h$ denotes the 
  ellipsoidal height. Unless otherwise stated, ellipsoidal coordinate sets are 
  given/derived in **this order** (i.e. $(\lambda, \phi, h)$) in units of radians 
  and meters. Note that **geodetic** coordinates are based on a reference ellipsoid.

## Coordinate Transformations
To transform between cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinate systems, one needs th 
define the *Reference Ellispoid* of the ellipsoidal set. In this library, this is 
performed via a template parameter. The transformation accuracy (see 
[here](test/unit/test_cartesian_ellipsoidal.cpp)) is about: $7\times 10^{-11} arcsec$ 
for $\lambda$ and $\phi$ and $3\times 10^{-6}$ millimetre for the height component. 
In cartesian descripancies, about $3\times 10^{-6}$ millimetre for the $X$,  
$Y$ and $Z$ components.
